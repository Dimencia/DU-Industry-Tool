# Older releases < v1.x are no longer maintained

Anyone could add the mining units or other new items, it's just a json file - but please share it, either through a fork or a PR.  Either add the new stuff manually, or:
1. Do a hyperion export of all item NqRecipeId's for all items (particularly the new ones), along with Name
2. Create a lua script to run core.getSchematicInfo(id) for every NqRecipeId.  Store all the data it gives you, and export it to json when done (writing to logfile is usually best to be able to copy it out)
3. Do a hyperion export of all item Groups (it's a separate category in lua export), the GroupId and ParentGroupId (see: Groups.json in this repo, but there may be new ones)
4. Using any language, lua or out of game at this point, load the recipe info json file, along with the Groups json file, and combine them.  Add fields as necessary to the recipe data to match the 'SchematicRecipe' class in Recipe.cs, such as 'Name', 'GroupId', and 'ParentGroupName' (Key doesn't need to exist and/or should be null).  I think those three vars are the only thing different from core.getSchematicInfo's output
5. Save as RecipesGroups.json and everything should work
